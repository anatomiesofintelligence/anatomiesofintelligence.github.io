# Draft workshop for Aarhus + presentation;

   **30min** round of introductions; names ++ and interest in AI; explain the AiO project; why anatomy / why ML;

   **15min** on the floor exercise: https://github.com/anatomiesofintelligence/anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/blob/master/anatomies_exercise.md;

   **30min** introduce ML; distances + dimensionality reduction. K-means as focus: first sudo code; and then we read our own algorithm; https://github.com/anatomiesofintelligence/anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/blob/master/workshop_presentation.html

   **15 min** catalog demo and collective reading of the clustering algorithm; explain the concepts of distance and dimentionality reduction (mainly necessary for vizualization; though essentialy this algorithms are already reducing dimensionalities). 
   
      catalog.cluster(CLUSTERS, MEASUREMENT, cut, ITERATIONS, resultfunc, BREAKPOINTS, osc, console.log);

      demo on the console/javascript api as an observational tool <-- provide commands catalog.cluster(3, Measures.euclidean, ["model", "aesthesis", "categorization", "body"], 10, resultfunc, false) https://anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/theatre/kmeans — > "help()"

  **15min** break
  
   _1hour exercise IRL clustering_

   **30 min** in groups clustering: 20 or more entries in their dataset — toy dataset (MNIST / image dataset)

   * distance (or the concept of difference);

   * tagging and weights (give values to data samples);

   * cluster: execute k-means and document the results;

   * representation of the knowledge system / communicate the process and results
   
 
   **30min** optional: experiment the process with another dataset / with different measurement systems; parameters; define a another cluster;...;

   Analyze the algorithm; further discuss potential entry points for performativity, presentation, critical intervention, aesthetic intervention within this algorithm.

   **15min** break

   **30min** group presentions

   **30min** wrapping up and discussions.
