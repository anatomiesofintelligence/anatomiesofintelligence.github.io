# Draft workshop for Aarhus + presentation;

### 30min
  
Round of introductions; names ++ and interest in AI; explain the AiO project; why anatomy / why ML;

### 15min** 

On the floor exercise: https://github.com/anatomiesofintelligence/anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/blob/master/anatomies_exercise.md

### 30min 

Introduce ML; distances + dimensionality reduction. K-means as focus: first sudo code; and then we read our own algorithm; https://github.com/anatomiesofintelligence/anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/blob/master/workshop_presentation.html

### 15 min 

Catalog demo and collective reading of the clustering algorithm; explain the concepts of distance and dimentionality reduction.

### 15min break
  
   _1hour exercise IRL clustering_

### 30 min 

In groups clustering: 20 or more entries in their dataset â€” toy dataset (MNIST / image dataset)

   * distance (or the concept of difference);

   * tagging and weights (give values to data samples);

   * cluster: execute k-means and document the results;

   * representation of the knowledge system / communicate the process and results;
   
 
### 30min 

Optional: experiment the process with another dataset / with different measurement systems; parameters; define a another cluster;...;

Analyze the algorithm; further discuss potential entry points for performativity, presentation, critical intervention, aesthetic intervention within this algorithm.
