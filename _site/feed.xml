It is not usually found in general and art dictionaries before the nineteenth century, but two examples appear in medical and philosophical dictionaries. In Barrow’s 1749 Dictionarium Medicum Universale: Or, a New Medicinal Dictionary, ‘aesthesis’ is explained as “to be sensible of, sensation, or the faculty or power of sensation.” The same definition is given in James’s 1740s medical dictionary. These appearances indicate that aesthesis was deemed specifically relevant in a medical context in the eighteenth century.
