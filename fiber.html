    <p>Following from a shared interest in livecoding and real-time algorithmic performance,
        we propose a research investigation into techniques for in-situ processual dissection
        of machine learning algorithms.
        In this research project, we seek to better understand the habitual and fixed objects
        of machine learning as well as their terminologies, and provide counter-techniques
        for conditions of emergence, movement-centered engagement and becoming.</p>

    <p>The anatomical theatre, which paralleled the emergence of the university as the premier
        learning institute in Europe, has been a time-space where bodies and their organ[isation]
        became spectacles of scientific knowledge. It informed and disseminated new classification
        systems and taxonomies, as well as a specific understanding of the body as a complex system
        reducible to its constituent parts.</p>

    <p>In our processual approach, we aim to develop an online repository of terminology and
        techniques for a critical examination of the “anatomy” of learning and prediction processes,
        data corpus and models of machine learning algorithms. And explore, through performance practice,
        how such a toolkit can confront the idealized bodies of artificial intelligence, its static
        representational structures and learning processes, by bringing about the re-organization,
        sectioning and bringing-into-relation of such codes.</p>

Ruysch's aims in creating his preparations were twofold: primarily to create useful, permanent aids for
teaching and lecturing; and secondly to create a personal art form. In this respect he attempted to
endow death with both elegance and moral value by using the light of science to penetrate the smallest
fissures and membranes of the human body. Thus by inducing a sense of wonder he sought to transform death
by imbuing it with the capacity to provide knowledge.

<blockquote>
«The Indo-European root of the word score is sker, which means ‘to cut’.
The term is thus linked to the notions of creating a notch and keeping a tally,
which is exactly what the Old Norse root of the word means.
There is, from the beginning, a double purpose inscribed in making a ‘score’,
that of performing a certain action and that of producing a physical record of an abstract quality or quantity.
The cut of the score, while splitting open the surface on which it is inscribed, fuses action with abstraction,
making them indistinguishable. It inscribes a temporal dimension on that surface;
the very act of inscription alchemically turns space into the physical expression of a certain duration.»

<blockquote>
    “...the answer to many of the why-questions evoked by the materiality of the eighteenth-century Leiden anatomical preparations—most importantly, why do they look so distinctly different than modern anatomical preparations?—lies in aesthesis. Aesthesis is a term that occurs in eighteenth-century texts and dictionaries, albeit rather sparingly. It is not usually found in general and art dictionaries before the nineteenth century, but two examples appear in medical and philosophical dictionaries. In Barrow’s 1749 Dictionarium Medicum Universale: Or, a New Medicinal Dictionary, ‘aesthesis’ is explained as “to be sensible of, sensation, or the faculty or power of sensation.””

    Part03: Jon [5] — Core questions: analytical/artistic framework:

    We will build the presentation around our growing research catalogue
    (which I briefly introduce on the AI meet-up) that gathers entries on both anatomic and ML references.
    This is also the dataset we will use to experiment in real-time with a ML algorithm to build a
    clustering model of the entries in the catalogue. The latter will serve as basis for hypothesizing and
    discussing possible categories around the collected material. terminologies[]?

    What have we learned from testLab?: thinking about epistemologies; how they are created and the aesthetics
    dimensions of that; and the connections with now: the epistemological regime emerging in times of AI.

"The reversal of the relation between organ and function amounts to liberating use from every established
teleology. The meaning of the verb <b>chresthai</b> here shows its pertinence:
the living being does not make use of its body parts (Lucretius does not speak of organs)
for some one predetermined function, but by entering into  relation with them,
it so to speak gropingly finds and invents their use. The body parts precede their use,
and use precedes and creates their function. It is what is produced in the very act of
exercise as a delight internal to the act, as if by gesticulating again and again the hand
found in the end its pleasure and  its “use,” the eyes by looking again and again fell in love with vision,
the legs and thighs by bending rhythmically invented walking."

    Part04: Both — Q&A

    How is machine learning influencing the production, experience, and storage of art, design and music?

    * incentivized artistic processes involving acts of collection / categorization -
    co-creative categorization; For example, by questioning the objecthood of the ‘model’ of a
    ML algorithm, and instead propose that a model be ever-evolving.
    Inspired by Christopher Small’s claim that music is not a thing, but an action, we rephrase the
    ‘model’ as always ‘modelling’, activating entanglements between people, algorithms, and contexts.

    * modelling as a process towards understanding / sense-making

    And what alternative insights do we learn from these artistic applications and experiments that we
    don’t get from market-driven innovations?

    * focus on process; embodiment, presence;
    * crucial to the anatomical approach: in/out of the black-box/white-cube-spectacle - binarims;
    * developing new metaphors (recognizing that these systems heavily depend on metaphors - e.g. “neurons”)
