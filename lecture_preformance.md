#### Aesthesis

> “Aesthesis in eighteenth-century anatomy was characterized by several factors: gaining knowledge through sensory perception; searching for perfection and elegance; dealing with disgust by either using visual or literary strategies; seeking systems and meanings in the negatives of deformation and pathologies; and a stabilization and categorization of the human body through commodification and decoration.” Source: Elegant Anatomy, The Eighteenth-Century Leiden Anatomical Collections.

#### Gestures of — Collection and Preparation

> “Through these reinterpretations, curators and audiences changed the fate of the collections. They prolonged their use in research and teaching, while at the same time – as we will see below – impeding the use of preparations as historical objects. But curators and audiences could never have completed the reinterpretations if the collections had not allowed them to. Their reinterpretations depended on the collections (and the objects in them) being sufficiently flexible. This flexibility depended directly on the material properties of the collections. In particular, with anatomical collections, the fact of whether the objects in the collections are preparations or models is vital, because of a fundamental material difference between the two, pointed out by philosopher of biology Hans-Jörg Rheinberger: preparations are made of what they represent; models (and other anatomical representations, like drawings) are not.” Source: The Fate of Anatomical Collections Rina Knoeff, Robert Zwijnenberg.

#### The Gesture of — cutting;

We start with a simple gesture: cutting. To cut open, to examine, in order to describe each organ and identify their functions, while discovering its relations to the whole — from organ to organisation, organicity. Some call it an empirical system to perform systematic dissection of the human body. 

Learning from each cut, the best techniques to dissect the body to effectively observe each muscle and how the body is laid out. We start by understanding the musculoskeletal structure, as the beginning of understanding of the function of certain specific organs. 

We are driven by curiosity and the desire to see beyond the surface level, the skin, pourous, our primary interface to the world. Inter-facing scores and scripts, inter-, in between gestures and codes.

Like a mapping exercise. The location of anatomical structures can be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks. Here the relationship is based on euclidean distancing: measuring the distance between each entry; while having no sense of direction nor orientation. 

The anatomist and the anatomized body. Iteration over iteration, calculating distances cutting across various lengths.


#### The Theatre & the Spectacle

> “Leiden’s anatomy hall is a brick building, the exterior of which looks quite unprepossessing. Inside one finds two theatres – or ‘snykammer’ as the Dutch call them – for anatomical demonstrations: a public one and a private theatre. … In the latter various glass cases contain the excellent anatomical preparations of Dr Rau … next to that one sees the portrait of Solingen, and the famous knife swallower, the head of an elephant, and three mummies.” _Source: The Fate of Anatomical Collections Rina Knoeff, Robert Zwijnenberg. Ashgate Publishing Company (2015)_

Staging Bodies of AI 

knife swallower = spectacle; GANS / neural networks; anthropomorphizing / animism for the rich;
the head of an elephant = knowledge ontology; the opressive force;
three mummies = three zombies of AI: anacronistic; no longer valid; living myths;

artistic research method: 
— concept of aesthesis/ aesthesia / embodiment / reliance on the senses / performance and performativy: a live/ embodied  but rule-based practice of ontology-making; rethinking and experimenting with scales and orientations for observation, affective response & affinity - and how such observations can be performed / presented as intimate / tacit understanding; endless practice, through trial and error, with hands-on work.

Performing a series of dissections, cutting through corpses, data, our anatomic dataset collection. Classiffied objects of knowledge, a new collection is born.

> So far, the preparations from the eighteenth-century Leiden anatomical collections appear to be predominantly examples of normal - or even perfect - human anatomy, prepared in such a way that they convey the aesthesis of anatomy. The result of particular yet tacit ideas of beauty, perfection and elegance, most of the body parts were chosen for these preparations because they were already in themselves perfect specimens: there are no obvious pathologies, and most of them were (part of) young, lean, healthy bodies. (…) Yet ultimately, severed body parts on the brink of decay - the ultimate emblem of disgust — are the constituents of this collection, and as in the course of the eighteenth-century research into pathology and abnormalities became increasingly important, an aesthesis ex negativo emerged: an aesthesis of the ugly and the imperfect.

> By preserving monstrosities like these in preparations, and averting the immediate danger implied by the visceral disgust such specimens would provoke unpreserved, their makers shaped them into didactic instruments and purveyors of meaning.
