## Anatomic Narrative {in progress}


We are here, in this Theatrum Anatomicum Temporarium to be dismantled after the dissection is over. Welcome.

Here we are driven by curiosity, and the desire to see beyond the surface level, the skin, pourous, our primary interface to the world. Inter-facing scores and scripts, inter-: between codes and gestures. 

We start with a simple gesture: cutting. To cut open, to examine, to describe the organs and identify their functions, while discovering its relations to the whole: organisation, organicity.  

Learning in which order to dissect the body to effectively observe each muscle and how the body is laid out. 
Operating while learning the whole body operates, a feedback loop.
Learning how to make a well-injected preparation is an art that can only be learned through endless practice, through trial and error, with hands-on work. It is truly about gaining knowledge from all your sensory perceptions—we used our touch, smell, sight and hearing, and it takes little imagination to envision the inclusion of taste.

Our experience affirmed that the task of making anatomical preparations relies largely on tacit knowledge. Denoting a reliance on the senses, to be sensible of, sensation, or the faculty or power of sensation. Some call it an empirical system to perform systematic dissection of the human body. 

And, building on the body of work on the agency of objects, I want to argue that a third party is involved in the process: the preparations themselves. Without their specific material properties, the reinterpretations could never have been carried out, as we demonstrate.

We started by understanding of musculoskeletal structure, as the beginnings of understanding of the function of certain specific organs. A mapping exercise. The location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks. The friction between each iteration. We witness the movement of the different entries— data clustering; constantly finding new positions the proximal (meaning 'nearest') and distal (meaning 'to stand away from’).
Here we use Measures.euclidean, measuring the distance between each entry; the relationship is based on euclidean distancing: It has no sense of direction nor orientation. Calculating distances cutting across various lengths.

An unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix -ad, meaning "towards", or sometimes "to". So for example, "distad" means "in the distal direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction".


Consider subcutaneous as meaning beneath the skin, subterminal meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or "more-or-less"; for instance subglobular means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-“. Like as in hypolingual nerve beneath the tongue, or hypodermal fat beneath the skin.

Similar to "sub"; a direct opposite to super- and supra-, as in Infratemporal space or infraorbital. 

Preparations, models and its users, mapping presences and the absences.

Here we are spectators of the same spectacle. Sharing the stage, a teatrise on the anatomies of a K-means clustering. Performing a series of dissections, cutting through a corpses, data, our anatomic dataset collection. Classiffied objects of knowledge.
Anatomical collections appear to be predominantly examples of normal - or even perfect - human anatomy, prepared in such a way that they convey the aesthesis of anatomy. The result of particular yet tacit ideas of beauty, perfection and elegance, most of the body parts were chosen for these preparations because they were already in themselves perfect specimens: there are no obvious pathologies, and most of them were (part of) young, lean, healthy bodies. (…) Yet ultimately, severed body parts on the brink of decay - the ultimate emblem of disgust — are the constituents of this collection, and as in the course of the eighteenth-century research into pathology and abnormalities became increasingly important, an aesthesis ex negativo emerged: an aesthesis of the ugly and the imperfect.

By the late eighteenth century, the making of anatomical preparations was still an act of selection, accentuation, and seeking beauty, even in the deformed and the ugly. By preserving monstrosities like these in preparations, and averting the immediate danger implied by the visceral disgust such specimens would provoke unpreserved, their makers shaped them into didactic instruments and purveyors of meaning.
Together, anatomists, teachers, curators, audiences and preparations determined the fate of many anatomical collections in the nineteenth century to the present.
