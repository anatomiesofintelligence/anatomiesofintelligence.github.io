Unpack the zip-file, and go to the folder you just created.

    $ cd /location/of/my/pydon/download

where `/location/of/my/pydon/download` is the path in your file system.

On Linux systems, you can usually use tab-autocompletion to more easily find the path, i.e. type `cd `, then the first letters of the path, press tab, and the terminal will show you the possible completions, continue typing until only one option remains, and go to the next part of the path.

Rather than using the command line instructions below to unpack the three archives inside the zip (`pyosc.tar.gz`, `pyserial-sensestage.tar.gz` and `XBee-2.0.1.tar.gz`) you can also extract them with a graphical tool.
