# Anatomies of Intelligence

Following from a shared interest in livecoding and real-time algorithmic performance, we propose a research investigation into techniques for in-situ processual dissection of machine learning algorithms. In this research project, we seek to better understand the habitual and fixed objects of machine learning as well as their terminologies, and provide counter-techniques for conditions of emergence, movement-centered engagement and multistability.

The anatomical theatre, which paralleled the emergence of the university as the premier learning institute in Europe, has been a time-space where bodies and their organ[isation] became spectacles of scientific knowledge. It informed and disseminated an epistemological shift, introducing classification systems and taxonomies, as well as a specific understanding of the body as a system reducible to its constituent parts.

In our processual approach, we aim to develop an online repository of terminology and techniques for a critical examination of the “anatomy” of learning and prediction processes, data corpora and models of machine learning algorithms. And explore, through performance practice, how such a toolkit can confront the idealized bodies of artificial intelligence, its fixed representational structures and opaque learning processes, by bringing about the re-organization, sectioning and bringing-into-relation of such codes.

Anatomies of Intelligence is a project by [Joana Chicau](http://joanachicau.com/) and [Jonathan Reus](http://jonathanreus.com/), co-produced with the generous support of [V2_ Lab for the Unstable Media](http://v2.nl/).
