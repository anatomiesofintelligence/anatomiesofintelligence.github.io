### Body Atlas — Awareness / or an Anatomic Journey {in progress}

__On the floor: breathing__

How is your body feeling today?

Weight/ lightness of you body; pressing the surrounding surfaces; The limits between surfaces.

The dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top. How hard is your head pressing the ground?

Keep the shoulders loose, relaxed, low and neck stretched; 

The ventral (meaning 'belly') surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism, release any tension.

Feel any other tensions in the rest of your body, the stress on the ligaments of different joints from top to bottom — release them.

Keep breathing.

Breathing is the bridge between the voluntary and involuntary — the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system; the conscious and the unconscious; the inner and the outer.

Activate the circulation.

Inhalation (contract the abdomen) > Retention (3-5sec) > Exhalation (expand the abdomen);

Breathing deeply helps circulation and oxygenation of the brain. Airstreams, generative circulation;

The brain is irrigated by 2000 liners of blood everyday and this blood passes through many miles of capillaries.

You are part of a vast circulatory network; which connects organs, functions, enactments.

Organ is the mother word for organ—ization. 

Continue breathing.

Imagine a map inside you consisting of arteries and veins. Move through this pathways within your body; 

Like a mapping exercise. Feel the empty spaces; the in-betweens.

Anatomical lines drawn through structures, and are also used to describe anatomical location. 

The location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks.

References may also take origin from superficial anatomy, made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. 

Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion (translation) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other degrees of freedom as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes. 

Choose one part of your body, and slowly rotate around the different axis. 

Anteversion and retroversion are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards or backwards respectively, relative to some datum position. 

Experience rotating towards the front of your body and towards the back of your body.

Now feel your spinal vertebras quiet and aligned, erect and perpendicular from your coccyx;

Remeber to continue breathing.

Feel the distance between. 

“Distad" means "in the distal direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction". 

Feel the distance between… your left hand and your lower lip; right elbow to the right knee;

The abdomen, or inferior ventricle and the liver.

Feel the distance between your forearm to the ankles; the distance between your shoulder blade to your chin; right nostril to the left eye, the cornea.
Feel the proximal (meaning 'nearest') organ to your cornea, in your left eye.
Feel the distal (meaning 'to stand away from') organ from your cornea, in your left eye.

Locate and touch your fourth cervical vertebra.
Locate the navel which is intermediating the left arm and the contralateral (or right) leg. 

While seemingly possible to map all the distances, the sacrum and coccyx are fused, and so they are not often used to provide location.

Continue breathing.

Inter- (from Latin inter, meaning 'between'): between two other structures, such as the intercostal muscles running between the ribs.

Feel the distance between your the pelvis and your neck and your throat.

From your wrists towards or up to the tip of your fingers;

Caudal (meaning 'tail') is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism, can you feel it?

Feel the extremity of other body parts, your neck; your stomach; your toes.

Consider subcutaneous as meaning beneath the skin, subterminal meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or "more-or-less"; for instance subglobular means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-“. Like as in hypolingual nerve beneath the tongue. Vocalizing anatomies, theorizing the body, flesh.


__Breath — standing__

Soft knees, quiet spine.

Visualize and light up your spine travelling from the tip of the tailbone, vertebra by vertebra up into the skull.

Use your chin to align help align the spine. 

The spine is just one of many possible movement centres. The center, the medial.

The body as poly centric. Polyrhythmic.

You can walk slowly through the space; and feel the distances in-between.
