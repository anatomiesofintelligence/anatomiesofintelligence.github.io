<!--     “Aesthesis in eighteenth-century anatomy was characterized by several factors: gaining knowledge through sensory perception; searching for perfection and elegance; dealing with disgust by either using visual or literary strategies; seeking systems and meanings in the negatives of deformation and pathologies; and a stabilization and categorization of the human body through commodification and decoration.”

    Pp.12 + “The eighteenth-century Leiden anatomical preparations are the result of a profound eighteenth-century aesthesis which includes both the continuous use of sensory perception as a source of knowledge and a permanent tacit quest for finding and understanding beauty, as well as dealing with the disgusting aspects of anatomy, along with the desire to commodify and objectify the human body.”

<h2 id="Intro_Classification_Clustering">Machine Learning</h2>
<!-- https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_arrows.asp-->
<div>
<p><span class="title">Machine learning (ML)</span> is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. <a href="#Refs">[1]</a></p>


<p><span class="title">Supervised learning</span> is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way. <a href="#Refs">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="title">Semi-supervised</span> (bootstrapping)</p>

<p><span class="title">Unsupervised learning</span> is a type of self-organized Hebbian learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels. It is also known as self-organization and allows modeling probability densities of given inputs.[316] It is one of the main three categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning has also been described and is a hybridization of supervised and unsupervised techniques. <a href="#Refs">[1]</a></p>


<p><span class="title">Deep learning</span> (unsupervised neural networks)</p>

<h2 id="Intro_Classification_Clustering">Data classification and Clustering</h2>

<p><span class="title">Classification</span> in machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition. <a href="#Refs">[2]</a></p>


<h3 id="Intro_K-means">K-means and notions of (Euclidean) space &amp distance</h2>

<br>

<p><span class="title">Cluster analysis</span> or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). <a href="#Refs">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="title">K-means clustering</span> is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-Means minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. Better Euclidean solutions can for example be found using k-medians and k-medoids. <a href="#Refs"> [3]</a></p>

<br><br><br>

<p><span class="title">Dimensionality reduction</span> or dimension reduction, is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction. <a href="#Refs">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="title">Distances</span> in mathematics, a metric or distance function is a function that defines a distance between each pair of elements of a set. A set with a metric is called a metric space. <a href="#Refs">[1]</a> A metric induces a topology on a set, but not all topologies can be generated by a metric. A topological space whose topology can be described by a metric is called metrizable. <a href="#Refs">[4]</a></p>

<p class="small">Figure illustrating Manhattan versus Euclidean distance. The red, blue, and yellow lines all have the same length (12), whereas the green line has length.</p>

<p>"In machine learning, many supervised and unsupervised algorithms use Distance Metrics to understand patterns in the input data. Also, it is used to recognize similarities among the data." <a href="#Refs">[5]</a> Commonly used distance metrics in machine learning are: </p>

<div class="small">
<li>Euclidean Distance</li>
<li>Manhattan distance</li>
<li>Minkowski Distance</li>
<li>Mahalanobis Distance</li>
<li>Cosine Distance</li>
<li>Jaccard distance</li>
</div>

<p>In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. <a href="#Refs">[6]</a></p>

This illustration consists of a simple outline drawing of a human body, viewed from the back. Captions on the image indicate the distances between various landmarks on the surface of the body, as an aid in establishing the location of acupoints and the paths of the channels at the back of the body. The units of measurement are the chi and cun, the length of the cun being based on the proportions of the individual's body, i.e. 1 cun = the distance from the base of the middle finger to the end of the crease of the middle joint. 10 cun = 1 chi.

<h3>Exercise: rethinking distances &amp proximities</h3>

<div class="exercise">
<img style="width: 60%" src="AoI_screenshot_ruller.png" alt="AoI screenshot of theatre interface and clustering">

<br>
<p>In groups, briefly analize your dataset; then follow the four main tasks bellow:</p>
<br>	
	
<b style="color:blue">— > (1) Define distance</b>
<br>	
<p>Collect and discuss diferent notions around defining 'distance' (or the concept of difference);</p>
<p>Consider existing methods, but also scales and orientations for observation, affective response & affinity. </p>
<p>Finally choose a choose a measurement system.</p>	
<br>	
<div class="small">
<li>What measurements and distances could be used?</li>
<li>Is your notion of ditance multi-dimensional? What are its dimensions?</li>
<li>How do embodied experience inform new thinking around measuring and sensing distances?</li>
</div>
<br><br>	
<b style="color:blue">— > (2) Tagging and Weighting</b>
<br>	
<p>Create a collection of tags to be assigned to the data samples/ each entry of the data set.</p>
<p>Assign the tags and give values to each of them.</p>
<br>	
<div class="small">
<li>What vocabularies emerge from the categorization and analysis of the dataset?</li>
<li>What can be 'put into words' and what is left unspoken?</li>
<li>How does the process influence the knowledge of the current dataset?</li>
</div>
<br><br>	
<b style="color:blue">— > (3) System representation</b>
<br>	
<p>Discuss how to represent the knowledge system you are building. And how to best communicate the process from tags (processual happening on the data collection) to the clustering iterations.</p>
<p>Consider dimensionality reduction and its implications (what is preserved and what is left out).</p>
<br>	
<div class="small">
<li>How to visualize the clustering?</li>
<li>What different viewpoints and perpectives and can used?</li>
<li>What other ways of making the process sensible can be explored? Which other senses can take part beyond visual? For eg. sonification.</li>
</div>
<br><br>
<b style="color:blue">— > (4) Clustering</b>
<br><br>
<img style="width: 60%" src="AoI_screenshot_cluster.png" alt="AoI screenshot of theatre interface and clustering">
<br>
<p>Execute the k-means clustering algorithm and document each iteration of results;</p>
<p>Define each of the variables:</p>
<br>
<div class="small">
<li>CLUSTER = 2</li>
<li>MEASUREMENT = Measures.euclidean</li>	
<li>CUT = ["anatomy", "theatre", "actors"]</li>	    
<li>ITERATIONS = 3</li>	 
<br><br>	
<b>catalog.cluster(CLUSTERS, MEASUREMENT, cut, ITERATIONS, resultfunc, BREAKPOINTS, console.log);<b>
<br><br>
<p><i>Optional:</i></p>
<br>
<p>Test the clustering using the <a href="https://anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/theatre/kmeans">AoI Theatre</a> JavaScript web api as an observational tool. Open the web console and type the script, as in the example:</p>
<br>
catalog.cluster(3, Measures.euclidean, ["model", "aesthesis", "categorization", "body"], 10, resultfunc, false) 
<br><br>
<p>Experiment the process with another dataset; with different measurement systems; parameters; and analyse how it impacts the clustering. </p>
<p>Further discuss and list potential entry points for performativity, critical and aesthetic interventions in the algorithmic process. </p>
<br>
</div>	
	
<h3>Further questions:</h3>

<p><i>
<li>What thoughts emerge after the experiments? <li>
<li>What different knowledge ontologies emerge through other geometries and directionalities based in bodily experiences and physicalities? <li>
<li>What is a unit of anatomical space and how can that inform embodied approaches to machine learning? </li>
</i></p>
