<h3><span id="title">Anatomies of Intelligence</span></h3>
<p>
	The anatomical theatre, which paralleled the emergence of the university as the premier learning institute in Europe, has been a time-space where bodies and their <em>organ</em>isation became spectacles of scientific knowledge. It informed and disseminated an epistemological shift, introducing classification systems and taxonomies, practices of knowledge collection, as well as a specific understanding of the body as a system reducible to its constituent[<em>standardized</em>] parts.
</p>
<p>
Anatomies of Intelligence is an artistic research initiative seeking to make connections between the formats and traditions of anatomical knowledge as a starting point for critical, performative investigations into the "anatomy" of computational learning and prediction processes, data corpora and machine learning models.
</p>


<h2>On Method</h2>

<h3>Aesthesis / An Observational Method for Empirical Technics</h3>
<p>
I was in the final year of my PhD research on eighteenth-century anatomical collections, and finally fully understood the curiosity, the immense craftsmanship and the endless patience embodied in the preparations that I had studied for over three years.

close readings of a select number of the hundreds of eighteenth-century anatomi- cal prepararations housed in the Leiden University Medical Center’s anatomi- cal museum, in Museum Boerhaave, the Leiden-based Dutch museum for the history of science and medicine, and in various storages around Leiden, aims to provide an exploration of the experiences, material and epistemic cultures from which these historical objects result
</p>

<h3>The Catalogue / Explorations in Collection and Preparation</h3>
<p>
	In our processual approach, we aim to develop an online repository of terminology and techniques for a critical examination of the “anatomy” of learning and prediction processes, data corpora and models of machine learning algorithms. And explore, through performance practice, how such a toolkit can confront the idealized bodies of artificial intelligence, its fixed representational structures and opaque learning processes, by bringing about the re-organization, sectioning and bringing-into-relation of such codes.
</p>
<p>

	It is hard to capture the experience of reconstruction in writing, but it can be an efficient way of gaining knowledge of techniques and insights into historical accounts. Smith stressed that after trying to do something yourself, reading a historical book or manuscript on that technique is no longer a linear experience; it becomes more holistic.3 This is defintely true, as I discovered when attempting to recreate an anatomical preparation.

as most of the why-questions are evoked by the materiality of the preparations. This means that I will borrow freely from methods and approaches originating in the fields of philosophy, material cul- ture studies and art history.7 In short, this book is object-centred; it uses pre- cise descriptions, focussing on the internal evidence of the object, followed by deduction and speculation, exploring possible connections between objects, people, and their intellectual and emotional responses to the objects, drawing from a variety of sources.8 This will eventually lead to a better understanding of why the object is the way it is, what its historical value is, and why it pro- voked certain responses from its makers and contemporary users

As our own experiments clearly showed, the circumstances of an eighteenth- century dissection room cannot be reproduced, as the moral and hygienic objections would simply be too big. However, even our relatively simple repro- duction experiment brought home truths about eighteenth-century prac- tices of making anatomical preparations more emphatically than reading any number of sources and studying any number of historical preparations ever could have, even if the results were a far cry from the refined, lasting prepara- tions discussed in this book

museum objects gather meanings through asso- ciation with the people that make and use them, thus linking their history and that of the collections of which they are a part to broader scientific and civic cultures




The catalogue is an investigation into the process of preparation that leads a collection of information into a body of data, a preparation that can be consumed and an ontology created... how does this process unfold? Documented in the observational practice.
</p>

<h3>The Theatre / Staging Bodies of AI as Spectacle</h3>
<p>
	Following from a shared interest in livecoding and real-time algorithmic performance, we propose a research investigation into techniques for in-situ processual dissection of machine learning algorithms. In this research project, we seek to better understand the habitual and fixed objects of machine learning as well as their terminologies, and provide counter-techniques for conditions of emergence, movement-centered engagement and multistability.

<h2>Researchers</h2>
<p>
	Joana Chicau [PT/NL] is a graphic designer, coder, researcher — with a background in dance. Her trans-disciplinary project interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreographic practices. In her practice she researches theintersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at in widening the ways in which digital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public.
	She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.

<p>
	Jonathan Reus [US/NL] is a musician and artist who explores expanded forms of music-making and improvisational performance through technological artefacts. His practice is cross-disciplinary and research-based, involving open and iterative processes of collaboration with practitioners from across the arts, sciences and humanities. His work tries to confront and challenge the representational capacities of mathematical-logistical systems, algorithms, and infrastructure through a practice of invasive intuition and trust in the diversity of lived experiences.
