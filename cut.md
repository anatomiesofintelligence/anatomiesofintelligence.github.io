## Introduction: The Theatre & the Spectacle: Staging Bodies of AI

Anatomies of Intelligence is an artistic research initiative seeking to make connections between the formats and collections of anatomical knowledge and investigations into the “anatomy” of computational learning and prediction processes, datasets and machine learning models.

Anatomies of Intelligence online repository gathers terminologies and techniques for a critical examination of the “anatomy” of learning and prediction processes, data corpora and models of machine learning algorithms. This catalog is a living research document into the history and present of anatomical science, as well as “anatomies” of artificial intelligence algorithms and data stewardship practices. The catalogue interface is also our platform to explore, through algorithmic performance, how such a collection and an artisanal algorithmic toolkit can confront the idealized bodies of artificial intelligence — its fixed representational structures and opaque learning processes.


## Staging: the gesture of — cutting;

Starting with a simple gesture: cutting. To cut open, to examine, in order to describe each organ and identify their functions, while discovering its relations to the whole — from organ to organisation, organicity. The begginings of exploring a vast circulatory network circumventing anatomical locations which connects functions and enactments. Some call it an empirical system to perform systematic dissection of the human body.

Learning the best techniques to dissect the body to effectively observe each muscle and how the body is laid out. Learning from each cut, hands-on, a humid sensation activates the smells in the room.

Aesthesis or “the faculty or power of sensation” was often used to describe scientific practices in eighteenth-century European medical and philosophical dictionaries. "Laying bare and learning about the inner structures of the human body, was best done through the use of one’s own hands and eyes. (...) However, although the hand and the eye were indeed considered to be the anatomists’ most important instruments, all senses, including smell, taste, and hearing were involved in the practice of anatomy."

Guided through the senses and driven by curiosity, or the desire to see beyond the surface level, the skin, pourous, our primary interface to the world. Inter-facing scores and scripts, inter-, as in between gestures and codes.

The anatomist and the anatomized body. Iteration over iteration, calculating distances cutting across various lengths. Performing a series of dissections, cutting through corpses, data, our anatomic dataset collection. Classified objects of knowledge, a new collection is born.
