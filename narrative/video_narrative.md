## The Concept of Aesthesis;

_open https://anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/_

On a rainy cold January afternoon, inside, you are with a small group of people gathered around an object. Everyone is leaning inwards towards what appears to be a body laying sprawled upon an inspection surface. 

The body, on closer inspection, is a body of knowledge. On the left side of the body lies a book that seems ancient, although it is impossible to tell from what era it belongs. The book is open to a page presenting a system of notation you don't completely understand, but seems somehow familiar. You can recognize it as a recipe of some kind, and the diagrams give you an impression of directions, orientations, measures.

`> catalog.allTags`

"We are gathered here", explains a voice from behind you, "because we share a desire to see beyond the surface level, beyond the skin, our porous primary interface with the world. Laying bare and learning about the inner structures of a body is best done through the use of one’s own hands and eyes. However, although the hand and the eye are indeed the anatomists’ most important instruments, all senses, including smell, taste, and hearing are involved in the practice of anatomy."

Pages turn in the open book, settling upon a page with a new arrangement of symbols, these resemble the pictograms of early writing cultures, and again give the impression of instructions, or a recipe. They look almost like musical scores, but rather than follow a straight and predictable path, the lines of the staff follow curving and weird paths through an almost alien spacetime, sometimes disappearing, sometimes reappearing. Tracing out movements in all directions, as if in between gestures and codes.

"The term, Aesthesis, was used in 18th century scientific practices to refer to the power of sensation. More than simply a matter of pleasure, Aesthesis was an entire epistemological worldview, a way to collect, present and possess knowledge."

## Staging: the gesture of — cutting;


https://anatomiesofintelligence.github.io/posts/2019-12-6-dissection

A force, a diffraction of light, sound and sense, moves upon a part of the body in a movement that is uncanny in its similarity to the movement of a human hand putting a pen to paper. It begins with a simple gesture: cutting.

The body is cut open. It is necessary in order to properly examine its structures; in order to describe each organ and identify its functions. The force turns and rotates, a single organ is brought into the environment of your perception.

"This is only a local understanding", says a new voice, one of the other participants gathered with you. "What are its relations to the whole?".

We turn to another page of the book. There are complex annotations, abstract drawings of inter-related organisms. "You know", says a voice echoing in the space, "organ is the mother word for organ—ization. Organizing and searching corpus of data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar.”

"We may call it an empirical system to perform systematic dissection of the ideal body", speaks the first voice again. The dissection continues and increasingly, you have the sensation that you are making the gestures with your own hands. You learn from each cut, and a humid sensation fills the room. "We are still learning the best techniques for dissection", reminds the voice.

In the past demonstrations were usually spread over several days, and limited to the winter months, in an unheated room facing northward to keep the sun out. These measures are no longer necessary. In the air there no longer lingers a smell of incense. There is no, far stronger, smell of rot. Although we still attempt to start with the most perishable parts of the corpus. There is still something unnerving, and unpleasant.

Dealing with the disgusting insides of the body and with severed body parts is, of course inevitable for anatomists. Paradoxically, is is also a manner in which to gain access to knowledge about the beauty and perfection of a data corpus. Can you imagine? That under all the bloody bias there is indeed something of profound beauty?

## Staging: perfection and ethics

```

For the 18th century Leiden anatomists Rau, Albinus, Van Doeveren, Bonn and Brugmans, perfection was at the core of their decisions for how to prepare and present objects of study.

Aesthetically, the objects had to be presented according to the ideals of the day: fixed proportions, perspectives and other conventions. Technologically and scientifically, the collections of anatomical preparations were aimed at demonstrating ever more perfect methods of revealing and preserving nature. A showcase of the most refined techniques, the most advanced crafts of preservation, for illuminating divine truth. Following the ethics of the early Enlightenment, the collections functioned like mirrors and helped in the educational, and therefore ethical, perfectibility of man.

The majority of anatomical preparations in the collections of the 18th-century Leiden anatomists appear to be predominantly examples of normal - or even perfect - human anatomy, prepared in such a way that they convey the aesthesis of anatomy. This aesthesis is the result of particular yet tacit ideas of beauty, perfection and elegance. Most of the body parts were chosen for these preparations because they were already in themselves perfect specimens: there are no obvious pathologies, and most of them were (part of) young, lean, healthy bodies. Yet ultimately, they remain severed body parts on the brink of decay - the ultimate emblem of disgust.

As this early Enlightenment-era anatomy developed, the study of pathology and abnormalities became increasingly important, and a new aesthesis of monstrosities emerged. An aesthesis of the ugly and the imperfect. An aesthesis ex negativo.

Pathological specimens like these appear often and are of great interest. They are the statistical outliers that in some cases break the model's delicate facia. But in most cases, they force a rethinking of the model's effectivity and are subsumed by it, reinforcing the model's power as a knowledge. By preserving monstrocities in preparations, the immediate danger implied by the visceral disgust such specimines provoke is averted. Instead, we shape them into didactic instruments and purveyors of meaning.

Now, close your eyes. How is your body feeling today? Feel the weight and lightness of you body; pressing the surrounding surfaces; the limits between surfaces.

In anatomy, the dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top. Keep the shoulders loose, relaxed and low, the neck stretched;

The ventral surface (or 'belly') refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism. Release any tension you feel there. Feel any other tensions in the rest of your body, such as the stress on the ligaments of different joints from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet — release them by doing short slow vibratory movements.

Keep breathing.

Breathing is the bridge between the voluntary and involuntary — the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system; the conscious and the unconscious; the inner and the outer.

Activate the circulation. Inhalation (contract the abdomen) > Retention (3-5sec) > Exhalation (expand the abdomen); Breathing deeply helps circulation and oxygenation of the brain. Airstreams, generative circulation;

The brain is irrigated by 2000 liters of blood everyday and this blood passes through many miles of capillaries. You are part of a vast circulatory network; which connects organs, functions, enactments. 

Continue breathing. In and outward. Imagine a map inside you consisting of arteries and veins. Move through this pathways within your body, feel the empty spaces; the in-betweens. Differences and proximities, like a mapping exercise which can be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks. Imagine anatomical lines drawn through structures, circumventing anatomical locations. Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion (translation) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other degrees of freedom as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes. Here though the relationship is based on euclidean distance: measuring a one dimensional distance between each feature vector in multiple dimensions; removing any sense of direction or orientation.

Now feel your spinal vertebras quiet and aligned, erect and perpendicular from your coccyx; Experience rotating towards the front of your body and towards the back of your body. Anteversion and retroversion are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards or backwards respectively, relative to some datum position. 

Remember to continue breathing.

“Distad" means "in the direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction".

Feel the distance between your forearm to the ankles; the distance between your shoulder blade to your chin;
Feel the proximal (or 'nearest') organ to your cornea, in your left eye.

Locate and touch your fourth cervical vertebra.
Locate the navel which is intermediating the left arm and the contralateral (or right) leg.

While seemingly possible to map all the distances, the sacrum and coccyx are fused, and so they are not often used to provide location.

Continue breathing.

Consider subcutaneous, beneath the skin, the subterminal area near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or "more-or-less"; for instance subglobular means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-“. Like as in hypolingual nerve beneath the tongue. Vocalizing anatomies, theorizing the body, flesh.

Caudal (or the 'tail') is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism. What is the equivalent in your body?

Visualize and light up your spine travelling from the tip of the tailbone, vertebra by vertebra up into the skull.

Use your chin to align help align the spine.

The spine is just one of many possible movement centres. The center, the medial. The body as poly centric. Polyrhythmic.

From the centre to the edges. Feel the extremity of other body parts, your neck; your stomach; your toes.

Where does your body end? Where does it begin? You can now open your eyes

```> project(Projections.SIMPLE2D)```

The anatomist and the anatomized body. Iteration over iteration, calculating distances, orientations. Cutting across various lengths and dimensionalities. Performing a series of demonstrations, cutting through the body, through datasets, statistical models, refinement after refinement. Classified objects of knowledge, a new collection is born.
