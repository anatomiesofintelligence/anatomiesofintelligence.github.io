## Sequence 1

### Intro: The Concept of Aesthesis;

On a rainy cold January afternoon, inside, __replace you are with__ a small group of people gathered around an object. Everyone is learning inwards towards what appears to be a body laying sprawled upon an inspection surface. The body, on closer inspection, is a body of knowledge. On the left side of the body lies an ancient book __replace that seems impossibly old,__ although it is impossible to tell from what era it belongs. The book is open to a page presenting a system of notation you don't completely understand, but seems somehow familiar. You can recognize it as a recipe of some kind, and the diagrams give you an impression of directions, orientations, measures.

"We are gathered here", explains the voice further behind __replace: of one of the unseen participants__ , "because we share a desire to see beyond the surface level, beyond the skin, our porous primary interface with the world. Laying bare and learning about the inner structures of the body is best done through the use of one’s own hands and eyes. However, although the hand and the eye are indeed the anatomists’ most important instruments, all senses, including smell, taste, and hearing are involved in the practice of anatomy."

Pages turn in the open book, settling upon a page with a new arrangement of symbols, these resemble the pictograms of early writing cultures, and again give the impression of instructions, or a recipe. They look almost like musical scores, but rather than follow a straight and predictable path, the lines of the staff follow curving and weird paths through an almost alien spacetime, sometimes disappearing, sometimes reappearing. Tracing out movements in all directions, as if in between gestures and codes.

"Aesthesis.", continues the voice, "The term, Aesthesis, was used in 18th century scientific practices to refer to the power of sensation. More than simply a matter of pleasure, Aesthesis was an entire epistemological worldview, a way to collect, present and possess knowledge."

A force, a diffraction of light, sound and sense, moves upon a part of the body in a movement that is uncanny in its similarity to the movement of a human hand putting a pen to paper. It begins with a simple gesture: cutting.

The body is cut open. It is necessary in order to properly examine its structures; in order to describe each organ and identify its functions. The force turns and rotates, a single organ is brought into the environment of your perception.

"This is only a local understanding", says a new voice, one of the other participants gathered with you. "What are its relations to the whole?". The perceptual frame shifts from organ to organisation, directing your awareness through a vast circulatory network circumventing anatomical locations. A network which connects functions and enactments.

"We may call it an empirical system to perform systematic dissection of the ideal body", speaks the first voice again. The dissection continues and increasingly, you have the sensation that you are making the gestures with your own hands. You learn from each cut, and a humid sensation fills the room. "We are still learning the best techniques for dissection", reminds the voice.

In the past demonstrations were usually spread over several days, and limited to the winter months, in an unheated room facing northward to keep the sun out. These measures are no longer necessary. In the air there no longer lingers a smell of incense. There is no, far stronger, smell of rot. Although we still attempt to start with the most perishable parts of the corpus. There is still something unnerving, and unpleasant.

Dealing with the disgusting insides of the body and with severed body parts is, of course inevitable for anatomists. Paradoxically, is is also a manner in which to gain access to knowledge about the beauty and perfection of a data corpus. Can you imagine? That under all the bloody bias there is indeed something of profound beauty?

For the 18th century Leiden anatomists Rau, Albinus, Van Doeveren, Bonn and Brugmans, perfection was at the core of their decisions for how to prepare and present objects of study.

Aesthetically, the objects had to be presented according to the ideals of the day: fixed proportions, perspectives and other conventions. Technologically and scientifically, the collections of anatomical preparations were aimed at demonstrating ever more perfect methods of revealing and preserving nature. A showcase of the most refined techniques, the most advanced crafts of preservation, for illuminating divine truth. Following the ethics of the early Enlightenment, the collections functioned like mirrors and helped in the educational, and therefore ethical, perfectibility of man.

The majority of anatomical preparations in the collections of the 18th-century Leiden anatomists appear to be predominantly examples of normal - or even perfect - human anatomy, prepared in such a way that they convey the aesthesis of anatomy. 

This aesthesis is the result of particular yet tacit ideas of beauty, perfection and elegance. Most of the body parts were chosen for these preparations because they were already in themselves perfect specimens: there are no obvious pathologies, and most of them were (part of) young, lean, healthy bodies. Yet ultimately, they remain severed body parts on the brink of decay - the ultimate emblem of disgust.


### Staging: the gesture of — collecting, freakish incidents, Devil's work and unknown categories.

As this early Enlightenment-era anatomy developed, the study of pathology and abnormalities became increasingly important, and a new aesthesis of monstrosities emerged. An aesthesis of the ugly and the imperfect. An aesthesis ex-negativo.

By preserving pathological specimens, or monstrosities as they said, in anatomical preparations; and averting the immediate danger implied by the visceral disgust — such specimens would provoke unpreserved, their makers shaped them into didactic instruments and purveyors of meaning."


### Staging: the gesture of — organ — izing.

Preparations as an act of selection, accentuation, decision making processes which define ways of seeing, seeing us — bodies made of flesh, of words made flesh. We turn one more page of the book, complex annotations trying to make sense of senseless figures, abstract drawings of inter-related organisms. You know, says a voice echoing in the space, organ is the mother word for organ—ization. "Organizing and searching corpus of data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar.”

Differences and proximities, like a mapping exercise which can be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks. Imagine anatomical lines drawn through structures, circumventing anatomical locations. Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion (translation) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other degrees of freedom as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes. Here though the relationship is based on euclidean distancing: measuring the distance between each entry; while having no sense of direction nor orientation.


### Grand Finale — staging the bodies of AI

The anatomist and the anatomized body. Iteration over iteration, calculating distances cutting across various lengths. Performing a series of dissections, cutting through corpses, data, our anatomic dataset collection. Classified objects of knowledge, a new collection is born.
