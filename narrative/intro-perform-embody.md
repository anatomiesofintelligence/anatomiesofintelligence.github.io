Welcome to the Anatomies of Intelligence.

Find some space, lay down on the floor, pick up a cushion, lay down your head or other body parts. 

Feel the tissue, membranes, can be synthetic or biological.

How is your body feeling today? Feel the weight and lightness of your body. 

Choose one part of your body, and slowly rotate around the different axis. Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion, for example translation along the X- Y- and Z-axes, continue slowly rotating. Take a deep breath. How is your body feeling today?

Breathe in and out. Breathing is the bridge between the voluntary and involuntary — the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system; the conscious and the unconscious; 
the inner and the outer. 
Inhale (contract the abdomen) > Retain for 3 to 5sec > Exhale (expand the abdomen); - - - - 
accelerate Inhale - Exhale; 

Breathing deeply helps circulation and oxygenation of the brain. 

Airstreams, generative circulation; The brain is irrigated by 2000 liters of blood everyday and this blood passes through many miles of capillaries. You are part of a vast circulatory network; which connects organs, functions, enactments. Who else is breathing in the room?

Feel the distance and proximity between you and other bodies in this room. Proximal in anatomy is the nearest organ to another one. Inter- (from Latin inter, meaning 'between'): between two other structures, such as the intercostal muscles running between the ribs. 

The location of anatomical structures, like a mapping exercise, can be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks. Here the relationship is based on euclidean distancing: measuring the distance between each entry; while having no sense of direction nor orientation. Stretch your body, where does your body end? Where does it begin? 
Open your eyes. 

Welcome to the Anatomies of Intelligence, you will be soon taken on an anatomic journey.

We are now ready to enter the main stage, the anatomic theatre.
A few important rules to follow: be mindful of other bodies in the room, move quietly and slowly to avoid echoing. Remember to continue breathing.
