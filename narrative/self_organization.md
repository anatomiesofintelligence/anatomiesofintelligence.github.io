## Organ(ization); Autopoesis; Statistical Ontology


The body is self-assembling. Smaller structures bonding to larger structures, clustering, entering into temporary dynamic relationships whose energy stiffens.

Knowledge is foreshadowed in life. So the relations between life and knowledge share the same basic set of organizational properties.

For knowledge to form statistically, we have no need to be creators. We investigate, we deconstruct, respectfully these bodies - sometimes while they live, during learning processes that attempt to reduce free energy. Sometimes as they decay, the decaying knowledge of a trained model. Knowledge does not keep any better than organs when removed from the body.
