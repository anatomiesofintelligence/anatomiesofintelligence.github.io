summary: Woodcut from Tong ren shu xue zhen jiu tu jing (Illustrated Manual of Acupoints
  on the Bronze Man) by Wang Weiyi, published in 1443 CE (8th year of the Zhengtong
  reign period of the Ming Dynasty), illustrating the system of proportionate body
  measurements. This illustration consists of a simple outline drawing of a human
  body, viewed from the back. Captions on the image indicate the distances between
  various landmarks on the surface of the body, as an aid in establishing the location
  of acupoints and the paths of the channels at the back of the body. The units of
  measurement are the chi and cun, the length of the cun being based on the proportions
  of the individual's body, i.e. 1 cun = the distance from the base of the middle
  finger to the end of the crease of the middle joint. 10 cun = 1 chi. See 'Lettering'
  for further details.
