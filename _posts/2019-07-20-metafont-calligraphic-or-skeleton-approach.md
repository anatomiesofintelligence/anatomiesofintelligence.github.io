The PostScript format, for example, describes letterforms by their contour instead of their skeleton. While yet other lesser known file formats might take an inverse approach. This is the case with Metafont, which originated from linear-drawing, writing and calligraphy where different kinds of pens (pointed, broad-nib, etc …) get applied to a skeleton resulting in different kind of characters depending on the pen.
