Usually the ontology building is performed manually, but researchers try to build ontology automatically or semi-automatically to save the time and the efforts of building the ontology.

Clerkin et al. used concept clustering algorithm (COBWEB) to discover automatically and generate ontology. They argued that such an approach is highly appropriate to domains where no expert knowledge exists, and they propose how they might employ software agents to collaborate, in the place of human beings, on the construction of shared ontologies[6]
