"Leiden’s anatomy hall is a brick building, the exterior of which looks quite unprepossessing. Inside one  finds two theatres – or ‘snykammer’ as the Dutch call them – for anatomical demonstrations: a public one and a private theatre. ... In the latter various glass cases contain the excellent anatomical preparations of Dr Rau ... next to that one sees the portrait of Solingen, and the famous knife swallower, the head of an elephant, and three mummies."
