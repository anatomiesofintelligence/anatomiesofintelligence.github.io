"Auzoux developed a special recipe for a paper paste, which enabled the construction of life-sized models of the human body that could be taken apart and reassembled. He coined the term ‘clastic anatomy’ (after the Greek for 'to break, to separate') to highlight the novelty of his ‘dissectible’ models. To facilitate independent study and the identification of anatomical details, the models were extensively labelled."
