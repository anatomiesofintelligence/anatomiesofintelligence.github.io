By using aesthesis as an analytical category and the materiality of anatomical preparations to understand the epistemic culture of which the eighteenth century Leiden anatomical collections are the result, I have put the actual objects that constitute these collections centre-stage without losing sight of the actors, work and social structures from which they emerged, thus transcending traditional historiographical categories.
