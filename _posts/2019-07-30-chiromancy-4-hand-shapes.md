summary: 'Earth hands are generally identified by broad, square palms and fingers,
  thick or coarse skin, and ruddy color. The length of the palm from wrist to the
  bottom of the fingers is usually equal to the length of the fingers.

  Air hands exhibit square or rectangular palms with long fingers and sometimes protruding
  knuckles, low-set thumbs, and often dry skin. The length of the palm from wrist
  to the bottom of the fingers is usually equal to the length of the fingers.

  Water hands are seeable by the long, sometimes oval-shaped palm, with long, flexible,
  conical fingers. The length of the palm from wrist to the bottom of the fingers
  is usually less than the width across the widest part of the palm, and usually equal
  to the length of the fingers.

  Fire hands are characterized by a square or rectangular palm, flushed or pink skin,
  and shorter fingers. The length of the palm from wrist to the bottom of the fingers
  is usually greater than the length of the fingers.'
