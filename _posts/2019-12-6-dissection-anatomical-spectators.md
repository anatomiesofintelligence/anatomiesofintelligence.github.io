summary: "The Dutch anatomist S. Blankaart, surrounded by seven observers, retracts the skin of the cadaver he is dissecting to reveal the intestines. Directly behind him is a door leading out of the anatomy theatre and above this, in a niche, is a skeleton holding a spade. Among the surgical instruments lying next to the corpse is a pair of glasses, on the left. Blankaart is similar in features and dress to his engraved portrait at the age of thirty-six (see this catalogue no. 1159), which faces the engraved title page in the Leiden 1687 edition."
