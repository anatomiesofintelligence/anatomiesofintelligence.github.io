summary: Handwriting Sample Form used in data collection by the National Institute
  of Standards and Technology (NIST). The database is NIST's largest and probably
  final release of images intended for handprint document processing and OCR research.
  The full page images are the default input to the NIST FORM-BASED HANDPRINT RECOGNITION
  SYSTEM, a public domain release of end-to-end recognition software.
