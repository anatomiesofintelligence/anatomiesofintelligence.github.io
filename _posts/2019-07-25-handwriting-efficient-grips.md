summary: "An  adducted  grip  (which  diminishes  the  proprioceptive  input  from  the  lumbricales  from  the  skilled digits) does not allow the luxury of the unconscious regulation of the gripping pressure on the shaft of the pencil or the downward pressure of the pencil point against the writing surface. This  is  the  reason  many  students  frequently  need  to  stop,  release  their  grip  on  the  pencil  and  shake  the  pain  out  of  the  fingers.  He  should  be  made  aware  that  power  grips  might  result  in  painful joint dysfunctions later in life due to the stress they cause to the support structures of the joints. The  following  sequence  can  make  the  transition  to  the  functional  grip  less  stressful  and  more  successful. 1.The  instructor  demonstrates  how  to  position  a  pencil  between  index  and  long  finger  to  make  large random patterns on the paper using only shoulder and elbow movements. 2. The child imitates the instructor by positioning the between the same two digits to make large free flowing movements (no finger movements, letter or number symbols are allowed). 3.  After  the  child  adjusts  to  the  feel  of  the  pencil  in  the  index/middle  finger  web  space,  she  should be encouraged to draw anything she pleases."
