summary: Look at the signs of the zodiac. They correspond to each part of the body,
  starting with Pisces, the feet, and working up their way to the head, with Aries,
  the ram, that has sacred connotations. In each top corner are painted the arms of
  the Duke of Berry. Each area is complemented by four Latin inscriptions describing
  the properties of each sign according to the four complexions (hot, cold, wet or
  dry), the four temperaments (choleric, melancholic, sanguine and phlegmatic) and
  the four cardinal points - 'Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are warm and dry, choleric,
  masculine, Eastern' in the upper left; 'Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn are cold and
  dry, melancholy, female, Western' in the upper right; 'Gemini, Aquarius and Libra
  are hot and humid, sanguine, masculine, Southern' in the lower left; 'Cancer, Scorpio
  and Pisces are cold and wet, phlegmatic, feminine, Northern' in the lower right.
