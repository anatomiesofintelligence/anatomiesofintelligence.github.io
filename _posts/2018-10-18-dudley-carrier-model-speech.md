summary: Technologies of speech processing such as speech recognition and synthesis
  is fundamentally dependent on a parametric concept of speech introduced by Homer
  Dudley in the late 1930's. An ideal model is proposed for the acoustic properties
  of the human vocal tract and speech is analysed and synthesized based on this model.
