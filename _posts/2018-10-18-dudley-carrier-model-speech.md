summary: Technologies of speech processing such as speech recognition and synthesis is fundamentally dependent on a parametric concept of speech introduced by Homer Dudley in the late 1930's. An ideal model is proposed for the acoustic properties of the human vocal tract and speech is analysed and synthesized based on this model.
