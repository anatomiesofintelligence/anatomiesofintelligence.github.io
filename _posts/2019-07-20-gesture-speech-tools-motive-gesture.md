summary: 'The hand''s modes of action became gradually enriched during the operational
  process in the course of human evolution. The manipulative action of the primates,
  in which gesture and tool form a single whole, was followed in the first anthropoids
  by _directly motive action of the hand_ with the hand tool separable from the motive
  gesture. In the next stage, reached possibly before the Neolithic, gesture became
  annexed by the hand-operated machine, the hand merely supplying its motor impulse
  by _indirect mobility_.

  In historic times motive force itself was transferred from the human arm, and _the
  hand intervened only to start the motor process_ in animal-operated machines or
  mechanic machines such as mills. Finally, in the last stage, _the hand is used to
  set off a programmed process_ in automatic machines that not only exteriorize tools,
  gestures, and mobility but whose effect also spills over into memory and mechanical
  behavior.'
