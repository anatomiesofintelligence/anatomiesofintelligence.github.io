## What Is the Ontology
The word “ontology” has been recognized in philosophy as the subject of existence. In the Artificial Intelligence community, ontology means a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.

Conceptualization refers to an abstract model of some world phenomena. Ontology concepts and the relationship among those concepts should be explicitly defined. Further, ontology should be machine-readable and the ontology should capture consensual knowledge accepted by the community [13].

Ontology is used for knowledge sharing and reuse. It improves information organization, management and understanding. Ontology has a significant role in the areas dealing with vast amounts of distributed and heterogeneous computer-based information, such as the World Wide Web, Intranet information systems, and electronic commerce. Ontology will play a key role in the second generation of the web, which Tim Berners-Lee called the “Semantic Web”, in which information is given well-defined meaning, and is machine-readable. Search engines will use ontology to find pages with words that are syntactically different but semantically similar.
