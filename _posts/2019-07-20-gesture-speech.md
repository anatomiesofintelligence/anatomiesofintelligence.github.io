summary: "The hand's modes of action became gradually enriched during the operational process in the course of human evolution. The manipulative action of the primates, in which gesture and tool form a single whole, was followed in the first anthropoids by _directly motive action of the hand_ with the hand tool separable from the motive gesture. In the next stage, reached possibly before the Neolithic, gesture became annexed by the hand-operated machine, the hand merely supplying its motor impulse by _indirect mobility_.

In historic times motive force itself was transferred from the human arm, and _the hand intervened only to start the motor process_ in animal-operated machines or mechanic machines such as mills. Finally, in the last stage, _the hand is used to set off a programmed process_ in automatic machines that not only exteriorize tools, gestures, and mobility but whose effect also spills over into memory and mechanical behavior."
