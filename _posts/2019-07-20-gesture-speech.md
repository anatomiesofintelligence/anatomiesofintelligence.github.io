summary: "The PostScript format, for example, describes letterforms by their contour instead of their skeleton. Yet other, lesser known file formats might take an inverse approach. It is the case of Metafont, originated from linear-drawing, writing and calligraphy where different kinds of pens (pointed, broad-nib, â€¦) get applied to a skeleton resulting in different kind of characters depending on the pen."
