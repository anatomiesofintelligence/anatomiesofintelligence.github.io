summary: "The IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB) contains forms of handwritten English text acquired on a whiteboard. It can be used to train and test handwritten text recognizers and to perform writer identification and verification experiments.

The database contains forms of unconstrained handwritten text, acquired with the E-Beam System. The collected data is stored in xml-format, including the writer-id, the transcription and the setting of the recording. For each writer the gender, the native language and some other facts which could be useful for the analysis are stored in the database."
