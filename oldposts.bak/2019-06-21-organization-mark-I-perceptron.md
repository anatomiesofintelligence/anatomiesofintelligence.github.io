summary: "Macro diagram of the organization of the MARK I Perceptron parallel computing system. The Mark I Perceptron is a pattern learning and recognition device. It can learn to classify plane patterns into groups on the basis of certain geometric similarities and differences. Among the properties which it may use in its discriminations and generalizations are position in the retinal field of view, geometric form, occurrence frequency, and size."
