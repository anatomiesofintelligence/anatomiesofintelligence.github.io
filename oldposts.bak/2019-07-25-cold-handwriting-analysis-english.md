summary: "Different Cloud of Line (COLD) distributions of writers from different nationalities.

Traits, namely,  gender,  nationality,  age,  height,  gait,etc.,are popular in the field of biometric applications, such as faceand iris  recognition[1,  2].  This  is  because traits  prediction helpsbiometric  methods  to  improve  their  performancesby reducing  the  complexity  of  the  problem [3,  4].  In  addition, traits prediction plays a vital role for forensic applicationsand securitybyhelping in  identifying  suspicious  behaviors[1]. However, it is noted from biometric based methods that when the  input  images  are posed  to an open  environment,  the methods  lose  accuracy.  This  is  due  to  inherent  limitations  of biometric  based  methods,  such  as sensitivity  to non-uniform illuminationeffect,  occlusion,  degradation, and  environmentinfluences. Besides,     the     methods     are     said     to     be computationally  expensive  as  it  involves high-levelimage processing   tasks. As   a   result,   in   order   to   help   forensic applicationsand investigation teams, handwriting analysis has received a special attention of the researchers,which has now reached beyond   traditional   boundaries   such   as   emotions nationality,  gender,  age  and  other  traits  prediction  [4,  5]. However,  due  to  large  variations  in  handwriting, ink,  pen, paper,  script,  age,  gender, and  individual  difference, it  is not so   easy   to identify   traits   based   on   handwriting   analysis accurately.  Therefore,  this  work  focuseson  nationality and ethnicity identification  asit  is  useful  for  identifying  crimeswhere different nationalsare involved.

Despite  the  problem  is  challenging  as  mentioned  above, one   can   expect   differences   in   writing   styles of   different nationals. For example, Chinese usually prefer to write letters with  more  straight  than  cursive.  This  is  valid because  of the nature  of their  national language,where  alphabets  and  text usually are formed with the combination of straight strokes. Incase of people originating from Indiaand Bangladesh, we can expect  more  cursivethan  straightness compared  to  Chinese because most  of  Indian and  Bangladesh  scripts are  cursive  in nature. With this notion, one can confirm that English writing changes  from  one  national  to  another. This  is  the  main  basis for  proposing  the  method  in  this  work.  It  is  evident  from  thesample images of each nation shown in Fig. 1,where it can be seen that each nation has a different writing style. At the same time,  since  all the citizens  of  respective  nations  follow  their own   scripts,   we   can   expect   English   writing   by   different persons of the same nation share the common properties
