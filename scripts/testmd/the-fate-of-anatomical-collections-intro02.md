Kidneys, livers, brains, spleens and other parts (often delicately tethered with tiny threads to glass splints so as to preserve the impression of levity) float in clear, opaque or ambered liquids; held in suspension like the pathological processes they exemplify â€“ arrested growths, odourless suppurations, pain benumbed, decay forestalled.."
