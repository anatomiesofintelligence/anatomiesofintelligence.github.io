summary: ' The first requisite, therefore, in the study of graphology is to classify
  the different types or kinds of handwritings. This will enable us to tell not only
  wherein certain handwritings re- semble one another, but also to distinguish the
  differences between the chirography of one person and that of another, for it very
  frequently happens that although we realize there is a difference between two handwritings
  we are unable to tell in just what particular features the difference exists ; so
  that we see at once the necessity for adopting some method of classification as
  a basis for the proper understanding of the subject. The study of botany depends
  primarily upon a system of classifying plants, and in natural his- tory, or zoology,
  very little profitable work could be accomplished were it not for a method of classifying
  the various animals. The same principle holds good in graphology, where we have
  a great variety of types and kinds to deal with. But this does not mean that we
  are to cumber our minds with an elaborate or intricate system of classification.
  On the contrary, it is very simple and very plain, for it is built up on certain
  definite lines that make it at once obvious and logical. '
