summary: In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the 'ordinary'
  straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this distance,
  Euclidean space becomes a metric space. The associated norm is called the Euclidean
  norm. Older literature refers to the metric as the Pythagorean metric. A generalized
  term for the Euclidean norm is the L2 norm or L2 distance.
