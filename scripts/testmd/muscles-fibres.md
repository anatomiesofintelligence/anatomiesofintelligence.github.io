summary: 'Observations on the muscles, and particularly on the effects of their oblique
  fibres: with an appendix, in which the pretension of Dr. Gilbert Blane, that he
  first demonstrated the same effect to be produced by oblique muscles as by straight
  ones, with a less proportional decurtation of fibres, is proved to be unfounded
  ...'
