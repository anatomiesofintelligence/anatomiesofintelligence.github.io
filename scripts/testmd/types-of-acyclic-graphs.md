summary: The word hierarchy, which originally referred to the nine orders of angels,
  is now used as an informal term for any partial order. The term tangled hierarchy
  is sometimes used for a partial order that differs from a tree by having cross links.
  Any binary relation can be represented as a graph, and every graph that represents
  a partial order is acyclic. Figure 3 shows three examples - a lattice, a tree, and
  an irregular acyclic graph that is neither a tree nor a lattice. Lattice graphs
  are used in speech recognition algorithms as intermediate formats to represent recognition
  results.
