PCA will find the "best" line according to two different criteria of what is the "best". First, the variation of values along this line should be maximal. The "spread" / "variance" of the red dots changes while the line rotates. When it reaches maximum? If we reconstruct the original two characteristics (position of a blue dot) from the new one (position of a red dot), the reconstruction error will be given by the length of the connecting red line.
