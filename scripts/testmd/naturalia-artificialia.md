summary: 'If anything, this preparation is the materialization of eighteenth-century
  aesthesis: it is both the result of the practical hands-on investigation of the
  senses, something which can only be done through sensory perception, and of seeking
  beauty and perfection in nature and sensory experience. (...) The addition of naturalia
  and artificialia to preparations of human anatomy quickly disappeared though. The
  informed contemporary observer must indeed have understood and appreciated the references
  made through the use of lace and plants. However, it appears such references quickly
  became irrelevant, even if the preparation itself was still appreciated.'
