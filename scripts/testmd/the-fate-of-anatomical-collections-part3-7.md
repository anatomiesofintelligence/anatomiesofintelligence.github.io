summary: Excerpt from The Fate of Anatomical Collections, Chapter 7 Adieu Albinus
  &#58; How the Preparations in the Nineteenth-Century Leiden Anatomical Collections
  Lost their Past by Hieke Huistra
title: On the Agency of Anatomical Preparations
---

"And, building on the body of work on the agency of objects, I want to argue that a third party is involved in the process: the preparations themselves. Without their specific material properties, the reinterpretations could never have been carried out, as I will demonstrate. Together, then, curators, audiences and preparations determined the fate of the Leiden anatomical collections in the nineteenth century.

Footnote: On the agency of objects, or material agency, see Bruno Latour, 'Where Are the Missing Masses? The Sociology of a Few Mundane Artifacts', in Shaping Technology/Building Society, ed. Wiebe E. Bijker and John Law, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1992, pp. 225â€“58; Andrew Pickering,  e Mangle of Practice: Time, Agency, and Science, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. My interpretation of material agency resembles that of Pickering: the agency of objects is emergent in time and shaped in reaction to the intentions of the human actors involved."
