summary: The Dutch anatomist S. Blankaart, surrounded by seven observers, retracts
  the skin of the cadaver he is dissecting to reveal the intestines. Directly behind
  him is a door leading out of the anatomy theatre and above this, in a niche, is
  a skeleton holding a spade. Among the surgical instruments lying next to the corpse
  is a pair of glasses, on the left. Blankaart is similar in features and dress to
  his engraved portrait at the age of thirty-six (see this catalogue no. 1159), which
  faces the engraved title page in the Leiden 1687 edition.
