summary: 'There is a most important fact to be learned from the very earliest graphic
  signs. In chapters 2 and 3 we saw that the bipolar technicity of many vertebrates
  cul­minated in anthropoids in the forming of two functional pairs (hand/tools, face/language),
  making the motor function of the hand and of the face the decisive factor in the
  process of modeling of thought into instruments of material action, on the one hand,
  and into sound symbols, on the other.

  The emergence of graphic signs at the end of the Palaeoanthropians'' reign presupposes
  the establishment of a new rela­tionship between the two operating poles - a relationship
  exclusively characteristic of humanity in the narrow sense, that is to say, one
  that meets the requirements of mental symbolization to the same extent as today.
  In this new relationship the sense of vision holds the dominant place in the pairs
  ''face/reading'' and ''hand/graphic sign''l. This relationship is indeed exclusively
  human: While it can at a pinch be claimed that tools are not unknown to some animal
  species and that language merely represents the step after the vocal signals of
  the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed
  before the dawn of _Homo sapiens_.'
