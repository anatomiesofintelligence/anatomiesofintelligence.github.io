summary: Macro diagram of the organization of the MARK I Perceptron parallel computing
  system. The Mark I Perceptron is a pattern learning and recognition device. It can
  learn to classify plane patterns into groups on the basis of certain geometric similarities
  and differences. Among the properties which it may use in its discriminations and
  generalizations are position in the retinal field of view, geometric form, occurrence
  frequency, and size.
