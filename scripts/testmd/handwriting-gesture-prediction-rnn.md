summary: Mixture density outputs for handwriting prediction.Thetop heatmap shows the
  sequence of probability distributions for the predictedpen  locations  as  the  word  ‘under’  is  written.    The  densities  for  successivepredictions  are  added  together,  giving  high  values  where  the  distributionsoverlap.
