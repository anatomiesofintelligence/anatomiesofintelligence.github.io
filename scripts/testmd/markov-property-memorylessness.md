summary: Visualization of a Brownian process (Wiener Process) in 3-dimensions for
  time t=0 to t=2. Brownian motion has the Markov property, or "memorylessness". The
  conditional probability distribution of future states of such a process depends
  only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. The
  Hidden Markov Model, a type of probabilistic graphical model, exhibits the Markov
  property in its internal representations.
