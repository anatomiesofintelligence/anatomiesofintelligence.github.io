summary: 'Mesopotamian tablet preserving a list of barley portions distributed as
  wages to farm labourers 5,000 years ago. It shows a very early stage of cuneiform
  writing in which circular holes were used for numbers in order to keep count of
  transactions of goods.

  It has been argued that writing in Mesopotamia originated from such counting marks.
  This counting system was used from 7500 BC onwards across the Fertile Crescent,
  from the Mediterranean coast down to the Persian Gulf.  Whereas simple tokens could
  be pressed into the surface and easily recognised, complex tokens with their incised
  patterns could not be so clearly distinguished. So their shape and markings were
  drawn directly onto the surface of the clay ball or tablet with a cut reed.'
