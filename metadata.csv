Marieke M. A. Hendriksen (2015)",,"Excerpt on Aesthesis and the epistemology of 18th century anatomical research. From Elegant Anatomy, Marieke M. A. Hendriksen","...the answer to many of the why-questions evoked by the materiality of the eighteenth-century Leiden anatomical preparations—most importantly, why do they look so distinctly different than modern anatomical preparations?—lies in aesthesis. Aesthesis is a term that occurs in eighteenth-century texts and dictionaries, albeit rather sparingly. It is not usually found in general and art dictionaries before the nineteenth century, but two examples appear in medical and philosophical dictionaries. In Barrow’s 1749 Dictionarium Medicum Universale: Or, a New Medicinal Dictionary, ‘aesthesis’ is explained as “to be sensible of, sensation, or the faculty or power of sensation.” The same definition is given in James’s 1740s medical dictionary. These appearances indicate that aesthesis was deemed specifically relevant in a medical context in the eighteenth century. Therefore aesthesis is used as an analytic category here, in search for a concept that can define a particular epistemic culture. It is very useful as it is a contemporary, eighteenth-century term denoting a reliance on the senses.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The length of the palm from wrist to the bottom of the fingers is usually equal to the length of the fingers.
Air hands exhibit square or rectangular palms with long fingers and sometimes protruding knuckles, low-set thumbs, and often dry skin. The length of the palm from wrist to the bottom of the fingers is usually equal to the length of the fingers.

Traits, namely,  gender,  nationality,  age,  height,  gait,etc.,are popular in the field of biometric applications, such as faceand iris  recognition[1,  2].  This  is  because traits  prediction helpsbiometric  methods  to  improve  their  performancesby reducing  the  complexity  of  the  problem [3,  4].  In  addition, traits prediction plays a vital role for forensic applicationsand securitybyhelping in  identifying  suspicious  behaviors[1]. However, it is noted from biometric based methods that when the  input  images  are posed  to an open  environment,  the methods  lose  accuracy.  This  is  due  to  inherent  limitations  of biometric  based  methods,  such  as sensitivity  to non-uniform illuminationeffect,  occlusion,  degradation, and  environmentinfluences. Besides,     the     methods     are     said     to     be computationally  expensive  as  it  involves high-levelimage processing   tasks. As   a   result,   in   order   to   help   forensic applicationsand investigation teams, handwriting analysis has received a special attention of the researchers,which has now reached beyond   traditional   boundaries   such   as   emotions nationality,  gender,  age  and  other  traits  prediction  [4,  5]. However,  due  to  large  variations  in  handwriting, ink,  pen, paper,  script,  age,  gender, and  individual  difference, it  is not so   easy   to identify   traits   based   on   handwriting   analysis accurately.  Therefore,  this  work  focuseson  nationality and ethnicity identification  asit  is  useful  for  identifying  crimeswhere different nationalsare involved.
Despite  the  problem  is  challenging  as  mentioned  above, one   can   expect   differences   in   writing   styles of   different nationals. For example, Chinese usually prefer to write letters with  more  straight  than  cursive.  This  is  valid because  of the nature  of their  national language,where  alphabets  and  text usually are formed with the combination of straight strokes. Incase of people originating from Indiaand Bangladesh, we can expect  more  cursivethan  straightness compared  to  Chinese because most  of  Indian and  Bangladesh  scripts are  cursive  in nature. With this notion, one can confirm that English writing changes  from  one  national  to  another. This  is  the  main  basis for  proposing  the  method  in  this  work.  It  is  evident  from  thesample images of each nation shown in Fig. 1,where it can be seen that each nation has a different writing style. At the same time,  since  all the citizens  of  respective  nations  follow  their own   scripts,   we   can   expect   English   writing   by   different persons of the same nation share the common properties ",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.131,0,0.997,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The word “ontology” has been recognized in philosophy as the subject of existence. In the Artificial Intelligence community, ontology means a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization.

Conceptualization refers to an abstract model of some world phenomena. Ontology concepts and the relationship among those concepts should be explicitly defined. Further, ontology should be machine-readable and the ontology should capture consensual knowledge accepted by the community [13].

Ontology is used for knowledge sharing and reuse. It improves information organization, management and understanding. Ontology has a significant role in the areas dealing with vast amounts of distributed and heterogeneous computer-based information, such as the World Wide Web, Intranet information systems, and electronic commerce. Ontology will play a key role in the second generation of the web, which Tim Berners-Lee called the “Semantic Web”, in which information is given well-defined meaning, and is machine-readable. Search engines will use ontology to find pages with words that are syntactically different but semantically similar.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
conceptual-clustering.md,2019-06-21,Jonathan Reus,text,,,Conceptual Clustering,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1625057,"Stepp, Robert E., and Ryszard S. Michalski. ""Conceptual clustering- Inventing goal-oriented classifications of structured objects."" 1986.",,,"Creating a classification' is typically the first step in developing a theory about a collection of observations or phenomena. This process is a form of learning from observation (learning without a teacher), and its goal is to structure given observations it to a hierarchy of meaningful categories. The problem of automatically cre- ating such a hierarchy has so far received little attention in AI.

Yet creating classifications is a very basic and widely practiced intellectual process.
Past work on this problem was done mostly outside AI under the headings of numerical taxonomy and cluster analysis (Anderberg, 1973). Those methods are based on the application of a mathematical measure of similarity between objects, defined over a finite, a priori given set of object attributes. Classes of objects are taken as collections of objects with high intraclass and low interclass similarity. The methods assume that objects are characterized by sequences of attribute/value pairs and that this information is sufficient for creating a classification. The methods do not take into consideration any background knowledge about the semantic relationships among object attributes or global concepts that could be used for characterizing object configurations. Nor do they take into consideration possible goals of classification that might be indicated by background knowledge.

As a result, classifications obtained by traditional methods are often difficult to interpret conceptually. The problem of interpreting the results has remained a challenging task for the data analyst. In addition, traditional classification-building methods describe objects by attribute value sequences and therefore are inadequate for creating classifications of structured objects. The description of such objects must involve not only attributes of objects as a whole but also attributes of object components and relationships among these components.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.88,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0,0,0,0,0,0

The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse. This sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance. In order to obtain a statistically sound and reliable result, the amount of data needed to support the result often grows exponentially with the dimensionality.

In chapters 2 and 3 we saw that the bipolar technicity of many vertebrates cul­minated in anthropoids in the forming of two functional pairs (hand/tools, face/language), making the motor function of the hand and of the face the decisive factor in the process of modeling of thought into instruments of material action, on the one hand, and into sound symbols, on the other.
The emergence of graphic signs at the end of the Palaeoanthropians' reign presupposes the establishment of a new rela­tionship between the two operating poles - a relationship exclusively characteristic of humanity in the narrow sense, that is to say, one that meets the requirements of mental symbolization to the same extent as today. In this new relationship the sense of vision holds the dominant place in the pairs 'face/reading' and 'hand/graphic sign'l. This relationship is indeed exclusively human: While it can at a pinch be claimed that tools are not unknown to some animal species and that language merely represents the step after the vocal signals of the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed before the dawn of _Homo sapiens_.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.987,0,0,0,0,0,0.956,0.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0

The manipulative action of the primates, in which gesture and tool form a single whole, was followed in the first anthropoids by _directly motive action of the hand_ with the hand tool separable from the motive gesture. In the next stage, reached possibly before the Neolithic, gesture became annexed by the hand-operated machine, the hand merely supplying its motor impulse by _indirect mobility_.
In historic times motive force itself was transferred from the human arm, and _the hand intervened only to start the motor process_ in animal-operated machines or mechanic machines such as mills.

""Knowledge acquisition via incremental conceptual clustering."" Machine learning 2.2 (1987) 139-172.",,Proposal for incremental concept induction algorithms towards creating statistical ontologies. Excerpt from 1987 COGWEB publication by Douglas Fisher.,"## Incremental concept induction
Many concept learning systems, whether they carry out learning from examples or conceptual clustering, are non incremental - all objects must be present at the outset of system execution.

In contrast, incremental methods accept a stream of objects that are assimilated one at a time. A primary motivation for using incremental systems is that knowledge may be rapidly updated with each new observation, thus sustaining a continual basis for reacting to new stimuli. This is an important property of systems that are used under real-world constraints (Carbonell &; Hood, 1986; Langley, Ki-bler, & Granger, 1986; Sammut & Hume, 1986).

Search-intensive methods may be appropriate in a non-incremental system, but may be too costly for incremental processing, since they require updating a frontier of concept hypotheses and/or examining a list of previously seen objects. Schlimmer and Fisher (1986) imply that incremental processes are profitably viewed as strategies operating under diminished search control. Specifically, they use a hill-climbing strategy (with no backtracking) to implement and test incremental variants of Quinlan's (1983) ID3 program. Schlimmer and Fisher demonstrate that the cost of object incorporation can be significantly reduced, while preserving the ability of the learning system to converge on concept descriptions of high quality. The ability to achieve high quality concept descriptions, despite the limitations of hillclimbing, is maintained by extending the set of available operators. Rather than restricting search to be unidirectional, both generalization and specialization operators are supplied. Bidirectional mobility allows an incremental system to recover from a bad learning path.In learning from examples, Winston's (1975) 'ARCH' program fits this view of incremental processing; it employs a hill-climbing strategy with operators for both generalization and specialization. This view can also be extended to conceptual clustering. For instance, Fisher and Langley (1985,1986) view Lebowitz' (1982, 1986a) UNIMEM as an incremental conceptual clustering system. Given a new object and an existing hierarchy that was built from previous observations, the program incorporates the object into the hierarchy. This results in a classification hierarchy that covers the new object as well as previously seen objects. Since UNIMEM maintains only one hierarchy following each observation, it can be viewed as hill climbing through a space of classification hierarchies. Second, UNIMEM does not build its hierarchies in an entirely top-down or bottom-up fashion. Instead, it has operators for merging nodes in an agglomerative manner and deleting nodes and associated subtrees. Node deletion selectively undoes the effects of past learning and thus approximates backtracking.

While existing descriptions of UNIMEM and similar systems like CYRUS (Kolodner, 1983) are not framed as search, desirable search properties can be abstracted  from them.  These systems use diminished search control and greater operator flexibility to navigate through hierarchy space, and thus employ a practical strategy for incremental learning. The advantage of viewing these systems in terms of search is that it requires explicit consideration of the 'goal' of learning and of the system's ability to achieveor approximate this goal.  The search framework forces analysis to move beyond anecdotal characterizations of system behavior.3. COBWEB: Incremental conceptual clusteringUNIMEM and CYRUS, along with the conceptual clustering work of Michalski and Stepp, have inspired the COBWEB system.  COBWEB is an incremental system for hierarchical conceptual clustering. The system carries out a hill-climbing search through a space of hierarchical classification schemes using operators that enable bidirectional travel through this space. This section describes COBWEB, filling in the details of the general incremental strategy.  Specifically, the section gives•  the heuristic evaluation measure used to guide search,•  the state representation, including the structure of hierarchies and the representation of concepts,•  the operators used to build classification schemes, and•  the control strategy, including a high level description of the system.

### 3.1 Category utility:  A heuristic evaluation measure
COBWEB uses a heuristic measure called category utility to guide search. Gluck and Corter (1985) originally developed this metric as a means of predicting the basic level in human classification hierarchies. Briefly, basic level categories (e.g., bird) are retrieved more quickly than either more general (e.g., animal) or more specific (e.g., robin) classes during object recognition. More generally, basic level categories are hypothesized to be where a number of inference-related abilities are maximized in humans (Mervis & Rosch, 1981). Identifying preferred concepts in humans is important from a cognitive modeling standpoint, but it also provides a basis for developing principled criteria for evaluating concept quality in AI systems. Category utility can be viewed as a function that rewards traditional virtues held in clustering generally - similarity of objects within the same class and dissimilarity of objects in different classes. In particular, category utility is a tradeoff

Graphology; Or, How to Read Character from Handwriting. American Institute of Graphology, 1903.",Internet Archive Open Use," The first requisite, therefore, in the study of graphology is to classify the different types or kinds of handwritings. This will enable us to tell not only wherein certain handwritings re- semble one another, but also to distinguish the differences between the chirography of one person and that of another, for it very frequently happens that although we realize there is a difference between two handwritings we are unable to tell in just what particular features the difference exists ; so that we see at once the necessity for adopting some method of classification as a basis for the proper understanding of the subject. The study of botany depends primarily upon a system of classifying plants, and in natural his- tory, or zoology, very little profitable work could be accomplished were it not for a method of classifying the various animals. The same principle holds good in graphology, where we have a great variety of types and kinds to deal with. But this does not mean that we are to cumber our minds with an elaborate or intricate system of classification. On the contrary, it is very simple and very plain, for it is built up on certain definite lines that make it at once obvious and logical.

### 3.2.1. Inertia
Inertia or within-cluster sum of squares distance is a key measure to evaluate the
internally coherent of clustering. The sum of squared distance is calculated between
each point and its nearest centroid.
### 3.2.2. Homogeneity (Shorthand as Homo)
In fact, the result of clustering should satisfy homogeneity. It means that each
point only belongs to a cluster. This rule should be also independent of labels.
The range of score should be standardized between 0.0 and 1.0.
### 3.2.3. Completeness (Shorthand as Compl)
Completeness measure how well the K-means algorithm assigns all the data
points with a given label to the same group. Meanwhile, the score should be
standardized from 0.0 to 1.0.
### 3.2.4. V-Measure (Shorthand as V-Meas)
Specifically, V-measure measures the harmonic criteria whether it has satisfied
the homogeneity and completeness. In addition, the score is from 0.0 to 1.0.
### 3.2.5. Silhouette Coefficient (Shorthand as Silhouette)
The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is defined as:

<a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=silhouette&space;=&space;\frac{a-b}{max(a,b)}"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?silhouette&space;=&space;\frac{a-b}{max(a,b)}"" title=""silhouette = \frac{a-b}{max(a,b)}"" /></a>

where a is the mean of intra-cluster distance, b indicates the nearest-cluster distance.
Moreover, the range of the parameter is −1 ~ 1. Specifically, 1 is the best
result and −1 is the worst result. The higher the score of Silhouette Coefficient is,
the more suitable the model satisfies the defined clusters.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02,0,0.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is significantly larger than the largest character in the (MNIST) database (at most 20x20 pixels centered in a 28x28 field). The reason is that it is desirable that potential distinctive features such as stroke end-points or corner can appear in the center of the receptive field of the highest-level feature detectors.
In LeNet-5 the set of centers of the receiptive fields of the last convolutional layer form a 20x20 area in the center of the 32x32 input.

""Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition."" Proceedings of the IEEE 86.11 (1998) 2278-2324.",,"Size-normalized examples from the MNIST database. The database used to train and test the systems described in this paper was constructed from the NIST's Special Database 3 and Special Database 1 containing binary images of handwritten digits. NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.
SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 are available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. In the experiments described here, we only used a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3), but we used the full 60,000 training samples. The resulting database was called the Modified NIST, or MNIST, dataset.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.976,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.697,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""On constructing a reality."" Understanding understanding. Springer, New York, NY, 2003. 211-227.","Springer, New York, NY",A description of neural computation by Von Foerster,"VII.Computation. The retina of vertebrates with its associated nervous tissue is a typical case of neural computation. Fig.15 is a schematic representation of a mammalian retina and its post-retinal network. The layer labeled #1 represents the array of rods and cones, and layer #2 the bodies and nuclei of these cells. Layer #3 identifies the general region where the axons of the receptors synapse with the dendritic ramifications of the bipolar cells (#4) which, in turn, synapse in layer #5 with the dendrites of the ganglion cells (#6) whose activity is transmitted to deeper regions of the brain via their axons which are bundled together to form the optic nerve (#7). Computation takes place within the two  layers labeled #3 and #5, that is, where the synapses are located.

Form computation: take the two-layered periodic network of Fig.16, the upper layer representing receptor cells sensitive to, say, 'light'. Each of these receptors is connected to three neurons in the lower (computing) layer, with two excitatory synapses on the neuron directly below (symbolized by buttons attached to the body), and with one inhibitory synapse (symbolized by a loop around the tip) attached to each of the two neurons, one to the left and one to the right. It is clear that the computing layer will not respond to uniform light projected on the receptive layer, for the two excitatory stimulions a computer neuron will be exactly compensated by the inhibitory signals coming from the two lateral receptors.This zero-response will prevail under strongest and weakest stimulation as well as to slow or rapid changes of the illumination. The legitimate question may now arise. Why this complex apparatus that doesn't do a thing? Consider now Fig.17 in which an obstruction is placed in the light path illuminating the layer of receptors. Again all neurons of the lower layer will remain silent, except the one at the edge of the obstruction, for it receives two excitatory signals from the receptor above, but only one inhibitory signal from the sensor to the left. We now understand the important function of this net, for it computes any spatial variation in the visual eld of this eye, independent of intensity of the ambient light and its temporal variations, and independent of place and extension of the obstruction.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.683,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.701,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0.602,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the first row the clouds have essentially one principal component, comprising 95% of all the variance: these are the cigar shapes. In the second row the clouds have essentially two principal components, one about twice the size of the other, together comprising 95% of all the variance: these are the pancake shapes. In the third row all three principal components are sizable: these are the egg shapes.

PCA fits an ellipsoid to the data. An ellipsoid is a multidimensional generalization of distorted spherical shapes like cigars, pancakes, and eggs. These are all neatly described by the directions and lengths of their principal (semi-)axes, such as the axis of the cigar or egg or the plane of the pancake. No matter how the ellipsoid is turned, the eigenvectors point in those principal directions and the eigenvalues give you the lengths. The smallest eigenvalues correspond to the thinnest directions having the least variation, so ignoring them (which collapses them flat) loses relatively little information.

statistical theory should not be applied onto data where the

For instance, data derived from a microarray study aimed towards
the establishment of a classifier which will discriminate
between diseased and healthy tissue might well describe
the expression levels of over 20,000 genes for each tissue
sample, with generally far less than 1000 examples of each
type of tissue. The problem that is encountered is the ‘Curse
of Dimensionality’ [14], which basically tells us that when the
number of samples is small compared to the dimensionality
of the samples, a perfect classification can be achieved in the
dataset by chance. The classifier will make decisions which
have little to do with the information content of the data.
This will produce a classifier which will subsequently make
poor predictions on new datasets. To solve this problem,
several strategies have been developed.
One such strategy is to select the individual single features
which show high discriminatory power between the classes.
This can be achieved by performing several possible statistical
tests to assess, for example, significant differences of
mean or median values across classes. This form of feature
ranking and selection will reduce the number of features
which subsequently can be used to build the classifier

""Analysis of complex, multidimensional datasets."" Drug Discovery Today, Technologies 3.1 (2006), 13-19.",2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.,Illustration of SVM Similarity Matrix,"Instead of working with the original sample representation
in the original 6500 dimensional peptide space, SVM and GP
classification methods operate directly on what is called the KERNEL
MATRIX (see Glossary). This matrix has elements which correspond to
the similarities between data points in the original space; in other
words, each element of the matrix gives a measure of how similar the
measured peptide profiles are between a pair of samples (red
indicates highly similar and blue indicates dissimilarity). So the above
figure shows how similar the peptide profiles are for every pair of
samples available, where each axis corresponds to the total available
samples (100 in total). The first thing to note is that we have now
drastically reduced the dimensionality of the representation of each
sample, from a point in a 6500 dimensional peptide profile space to a
point in a 100 dimensional ‘peptide profile similarity space’. The
second thing to note is that the matrix identifies that there are two
groups of samples which all share highly similar peptide profiles
(samples 1–45 and samples 46–86) with some evidence of a smaller
group (samples 86–100). This data representation is now employed in
SVM and GP classifiers rather than the original multidimensional
space.

SVMs often are reported as achieving superior classification performance compared to other methods
when compared across most applications and tasks. What
is of importance is that they are fairly insensitive to the ‘Curse
of Dimensionality’, primarily because of the use of the ‘kernel’
matrix [26]. This matrix is derived from the similarities
between samples and thus operate on dimensions which are
equal to the number of data points available. (Figure 3 gives
an example derived from 100 samples, each of dimension
6500.) Therefore, SVMs are computationally reasonably efficient
to cope with large-scale classification in both sample
and variables. In clinical bioinformatics, they have the potential
to provide powerful experimental disease diagnostic
models based on gene or protein expression data with thousands
of features and a small number, as little as a few dozen

How could this kaleidoscopic ensemble, in which skeletons and anatomical preparations accounted for only a relatively small share compared to the vast bulk of naturalia and artificialia, have functioned in combination with the anatomical demonstrations and instruction that also took place at this location?
Anatomy in the early seventeenth century can be considered an investigation by means of the fabric of the dead human body into the essence of the human being, namely the evidence it shows of God’s in nite wisdom and providence. Man – the pinnacle of Creation – is the most perfect example of God’s work in the world. But it is not the only example. Knowledge of God’s work in the world through anatomy would be insufficient and incomplete without a much wider understanding of the Book of Nature and the moral and philosophical place of man therein. Hence Heurnius’s ensembles of engravings representing biblical, mythical and emblematic themes, of objects from the earliest stages of history, where biblical tradition and the literary sources of Antiquity meet, and of naturalia and ethnographica showing the wonders of nature and the endless variety of creation.

Cambridge, MA Harvard University Press, 1981.",,"... a great deal in psychology hinges on how people acquire and use concepts, which in turn depends on the structure of concepts. .. Until recently the dominant position — which we will call the classical view, held that all instances of a concept shared common properties, and that these common properties were necessary and sufficient to define the concept. This view, which dates back to Aristotle, has always had its critics, but in the past decade the criticisms have become more frequent and intense, and new views have emerged. Perhaps the most prominent of these assumes that instances of a concept vary in the degree to which they share certain properties, and consequently vary in the degree to which they represent the concept. This view has sometimes gone by the name of prototype, but since this label has been used to mean many different things, we prefer to call it the probabilistic view. Another emerging view, which offers an even more extreme departure from the classical one, holds that there is no single representation of an entire class or concept, but only specific representations of the class's exemplars. This we call the exemplar view.",,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.271,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

descriptor labels used to characterise a measure’s general behaviour for each given test.

* Constant functions are indicated by the symbol C.
* Linear functions are indicated by the symbol L, with a subscript of either F or R to
indicate whether their value respectively falls or rises over the interval.
* Non-linear functions are described in terms of whether the absolute value of their derivative
over the interval is increasing or decreasing, i.e. whether the function value is
accelerating or decelerating. Decelerating functions are indicated by the symbol D, and accelerating functions by the letter A, with subscripts F and R indicating falling and
rising behaviour as before.
* Sigmoid functions can be described as piecewise functions assembled from a pair of
falling or a pair of rising functions, with the two members of the pair exhibiting opposite
accelerating/decelerating behaviour. So for instance, the shape labelled as SADF in Fig. 6g
is constructed from an initial AF function followed by a DF function. The other three
sigmoid functions are defined similarly.
* Functions which are undefined over the interval are indicated by a U.
* Other functions are indicated by an X, however there is only one such function (Forbes
in the Incremental Independence test.)",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.311,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
